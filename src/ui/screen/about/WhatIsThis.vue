        <p>
            Succubus Club is a platform for playing V:TES (Vampire: The Eternal Struggle) card game
            in a web browser. You can confront fellow Kindred in multiplayer games or experiment
            with your deck against a rudimentary bot (who never judges your questionable card
            choices).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a fan-made project crafted by a passionate player who clearly has too much time
            on their hands. It's completely free, with no ads and no tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Multiplayer runs on a peer-to-peer system, which means there's no authoritative server
            keeping watch. This makes cheating embarrassingly easy, so the whole thing relies on
            trust and good sportsmanship. Please be fair !
        </p>

        <p>
            Since there's no central server, there are no accounts either – all your data stays in
            your browser's local storage.
